# Dye Master for Skyrim SE

This adds a set of dyes to extend or replace the ugly default colours that come with Dye Manager. In addition to mixing dyes like Dye Manager already allows, you will have access to more colours in general for an even wider variety, mixed or not.

1) Dyes can be bought from general store type vendor and merchants. They will sell a random selection. The clothing store in solitude will often have the largest selection.

2) Dyes can be found as loot in things like cupboards, wardrobes, and end tables.

3) Dyes can be found pickpocketing people sometimes.

4) Dyes can be crafted from various things you find around Skyrim.

# Installation

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Vendors are not selling dyes?**

It is likely they will not sell them immediately after installation as their inventories will need to be restocked by the game first. Not all vendors sell them. Just clothing and general store type merchants.

**Can I suggest a colour?**

Sure. Send me the hex code. But also remember you an mix dyes together in-game with Dye Manager while you are dyeing things.

**How do I craft the Dyes?**

At any cooking pot. You have to boil various things to extract the dye.

**My Armour Wont Change Colour!**

It has to support the dye system first. That is not this mod's problem.

**The same colour looks different on two different armours?**

That also is not this mod's problem. There will be variations depending on the textures of the armour and the blending modes they selected when making it support the dye system.
